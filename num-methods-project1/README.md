# Project 1 â€“ Numerical Methods for Differential Equations

This project investigates finite difference methods for numerical differentiation and several schemes for solving linear ODEs, including Euler methods, implicit midpoint, and Rungeâ€“Kutta methods.  
All implementations are written in MATLAB, with a focus on error analysis, convergence rates, and stability comparisons.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Components

### Numerical Differentiation (Finite Differences)
- **File:** `sciprog_a12.m`  
- Implemented the one-sided finite difference quotient D_h f(x0) = (f(x0+h) - f(x0)) / h.  
- Evaluated derivatives of:
  - f(x) = exp(x) at x0 = 0 (exact derivative = 1),  
  - f(x) = sin(x) at x0 = 0 (exact derivative = 1),  
  - f(x) = x^(3/2) at x0 = 0 (exact derivative = 0).  
- Computed the error e_h = |f'(x0) - D_h f(x0)| for step sizes h = 2^-n, n=0â€¦10.  
- Produced logâ€“log error plots and tabulated convergence orders.  
- Observed first-order convergence for smooth functions (exp, sin), while the non-smooth function x^(3/2) showed slower convergence.

### Implementation of Euler & Midpoint Schemes
- **File:** `sciprog_a13.m`  
- Implemented three one-step methods as MATLAB functions with signatures:
  - `y = explicitEuler(t, f1, f2, y0)`
  - `y = implicitEuler(t, f1, f2, y0)`
  - `y = implicitMidpoint(t, f1, f2, y0)`  
- Each function computes the discrete solution y(t_n) for linear scalar IVPs of the form y'(t) = f1(t) + f2(t)y(t).  
- Verified correctness on small test cases.

### Testing the Schemes on Scalar Problems
- **Files:** `sciprog_a14a.m`, `sciprog_a14b.m`  
- Applied explicit Euler, implicit Euler, and implicit midpoint to:
  1. y'(t) = -y(t), y(0)=1, exact solution y(t)=exp(-t).  
     - Computed numerical solutions for step sizes h = 1/L.  
     - Plotted exact solution and all three approximations in the same figure.  
     - Computed error in the maximum norm: e_h = max |y(t_n) - y_n|.  
     - Plotted error vs h on a logâ€“log scale to observe convergence rates.  
  2. y'(t) = 2 - y(t), y(0)=5.  
     - Compared growth/decay behavior across the three methods.  
     - Highlighted how implicit methods better capture stability.

### Extending to Systems of ODEs
- **File:** `sciprog_a15.m`  
- Generalized all three methods to vector problems y'(t) = f1(t) + f2(t) y(t),  
  where f1 is a vector and f2 is a matrix.  
- Implemented the update rules in matrix form and verified they reduce to the scalar case when d=1.

### Linear System Case Study
- **Files:** `sciprog_a16a.m`, `sciprog_a16b.m`  
- Applied the vector methods to the coupled system:
  - y1'(t) = -y2(t),  
  - y2'(t) = y1(t),  
  with initial values y1(0)=1, y2(0)=0.  
- Exact solution: y(t) = (cos(t), sin(t)).  
- Computed numerical solutions with different step sizes.  
- Produced:
  - Error plots e_h vs h for explicit/implicit Euler and midpoint.  
  - Phase plots (y1 vs y2) showing how explicit Euler spirals outward (unstable), while implicit methods stay closer to the unit circle.

### Rungeâ€“Kutta Methods
- **Files:** `sciprog_a17.m`, `sciprog_a18.m`, `sciprog_a19.m`  
- Implemented a general explicit Rungeâ€“Kutta solver given Butcher tableau (A, b, c).  
- Extended to systems (vector-valued problems).  
- Tested with the classical 4th-order Rungeâ€“Kutta method (RK4).  
- Compared convergence rates of Euler vs RK4 on y'(t)=-y(t).  
- Produced logâ€“log error plots confirming 4th-order convergence of RK4.  
- Added phase plots for the system y1'=-y2, y2'=y1, showing RK4 preserves the circular trajectory much better than Euler methods.

## ðŸ“Š Key Outcomes
- Confirmed first-order convergence for the one-sided finite difference scheme on smooth functions.  
- Demonstrated through plots how explicit Euler is unstable for oscillatory systems, while implicit methods provide stability.  
- Showed midpoint and RK4 methods balance stability and accuracy, with RK4 achieving clear 4th-order error decay.  
- Phase plots provided strong visual evidence of stability differences across methods.
