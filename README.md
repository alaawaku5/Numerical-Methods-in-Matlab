# Numerical Methods in MATLAB

This repository contains a collection of projects developed as part of the course *Scientific Programming for Interdisciplinary Mathematics*.  
Each project explores a different aspect of **numerical analysis** and **scientific computing**, implemented in MATLAB with a focus on accuracy, convergence, and efficiency.  

The projects progress from basic finite difference approximations to advanced finite element methods (FEM) in 2D.  
All codes are self-contained and include plots, error analysis, and comparisons with exact solutions where available.
